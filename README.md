# QTM385-5
**QTM 385-5: Elements of Data Science; Python, SQL, and Advanced R**

This repository contains the course materials and assignments for QTM 385-5: Python, SQL, and R.
This class will advance the skills required for the student for successful data analytics. 
We will cover Python from elementary to advanced programming skills and data wrangling in the first half. 
In the second half, we will introduce relational databases, provide an overview of SQL (Structured Query Language), 
and discuss advanced topics in R, such as data scraping and data wrangling. 

This class's successful completion will qualify the students to solve complex programming and data processing problems, 
getting their data ready for advanced machine learning.

This Github Repository will contain a portfolio of all class materials and homeworks for the semester
to display the progression of my coding skills and capabilities.
